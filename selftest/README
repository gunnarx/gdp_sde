How does the self test work?

1. Externally from the host, the VM is configured to have a shared folder
named /selftest which has the selftest scripts.  For automated tests,
adding this shared folder can be scripted. (optional - see 3a)

2. ~/.config/autostart is the Freedesktop standard for automatically
started applications (described by .desktop files) In this directory a
.desktop file was added which runs the first script which is also located
inside ~/.config/autostart

3. That script mount_and_start.sh will execute $ sudo mount /selftest...
3 a) If the mount fails because the VM was not configured to have the shared
     folder then this simply fails.  (Equivalent with: The VM is not configured
     to run self-test)
NOTE: The user, vagrant, is typically set up for passwordless sudo which is
why the mounting works.

4. The mount_and_start script executes the entrypoint run.sh from /selftest

5. run.sh is currently set up to start all applications with some delay
between each, and eventually killing them again. That is done by executing
pcmanfm on each app that we have as a .desktop file.  This is equivalent
with launching each desktop icon.

For the first setup here, there is no programatic check that applications
run OK - the test is assumed to be looked at by a human through a
screencast movie.
