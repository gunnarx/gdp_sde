GENIVI Development Platform (GDP)
Software Development Environment (SDE) - VirtualBox image.

Licenses, source code, and recreating the image from scratch
=============================================================

A downloadable VM image is provided for your convenience. It is built 
based on a standard Ubuntu 14.04 system.  (The Vagrant base box for
16.04 has an inconvenient bug - bug we might upgrade soon).

All the source code making up this system is provided, both for all
software whose license requires it, and for many that do not.

First, a collection of source code matching all installed software packages
in this particular Ubuntu system should be found where you downloaded the
image*. This contains source code for the installed packages that are part
of Ubuntu.  Programs that are not part of standard Ubuntu are not included
in that package - instructions for them follow below.

*HOWEVER: We really would not recommend downloading the aforementioned
Ubuntu source package since there are much more convenient ways to acquire
the source code and required build environment of a fully open-source
system like Debian/Ubuntu:  

Instead, it is likely more convenient for you to use the following command
run in a terminal from inside of this system:

$ sudo apt-get build-dep $package   # (for build deps)
$ sudo apt-get source $package

for each program you are interested in.

To list all installed packages you may try:
$ dpkg --get-selections

To reference software copyright information and original location of source
code and documentation for using and building, you could start with this
file:

ftp://ftp.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/source/Sources.bz2

...or the same file on any official Ubuntu mirror.

We also offer a way to reproduce the building of this system as a whole.
All necessary source and binary code references, and all build instructions
to recreate the system is available for you by starting with the "SDE"
pipeline instructions on https://go.genivi.org and the repository:
https://github.com/genivi/gdp_sde.git

(In order to view/edit the steps in the go.genivi.org system you may need
 to request a personal account.)

If any of the given URLs end up being broken, we recommend you check the
GENIVI public Wiki: (currently https://projects.genivi.org), where you
ought to find up to date information somewhere under the GDP project, as
well as mailing lists that can be used to reach developers.

Here follows information about the software that has been added in
addition to standard Ubuntu packages:

1. The source code for Qt is provided inside the Src directory of the
installation, which contains that which the standard online installer from
the Qt Company installs when source code is requested.

Qt is also available with a commercial license.  The version we are
providing here is offered using GPL and other open-source licenses.  
Please refer to the source code headers for details.

2. The Eclipse installation is based on a standard Eclipse Luna with DSL
environment, as offered from download.eclipse.org, licensed with the
Eclipse Public License.  Luna is used because of compatibility with 
Franca in the particular version that is also compatible with CommonAPI C++
(refer to Franca IDL project on GitHub for more information - see
below)

Although it is frankly a little difficult to get clear information on
corresponding source code for a particular binary download from the Eclipse
project itself, we can provide the following information:

To recreate this setup you can download a binary distribution (DSL version)
and then install the packages for Franca and CommonAPI tooling.
The following project could help to automate that activity:
https://github.com/GENIVI/eclipse_install_automation.git

...or you can build from source. Source code for Eclipse environment is
provided by the help of the Eclipse project. To build Eclipse platform you
can fetch the main project from:
git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git
Building that project will fetch relevant source code. The tag used for
Luna release is R4_4_2.

4. Source code for the Franca IDL tooling is available from
https://github.com/franca/franca

5. Source code for CommonAPI C++ related tooling is available from:
https://github.com/GENIVI/common-api-tools.git
   or (name change) https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-tools.git
https://github.com/GENIVI/common-api-someip-tools.git
   or (name change) https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-someip-tools.git
https://github.com/GENIVI/common-api-dbus-tools.git
   or (name change) https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-dbus-tools.git

and build instructions are provided as part of the README inside of each
project.

6. Source code for DLT-Viewer is available from
https://github.com/GENIVI/dlt-viewer.git

License information should be given in each install directory.  If it
isn't, please refer to the LICENSE or COPYING file that will be in each
source code repository specified above.
